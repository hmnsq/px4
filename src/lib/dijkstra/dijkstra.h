 *
 * Backward single-source Dijkstra over a precomputed asymmetric cost matrix.
 *
 * `solveBackward` computes the shortest path from every node to a fixed `goal`
 * and returns, for each node `i`, the next node to step toward on its shortest
 * path to the goal. The intended usage is:
 *
 *   1. Whenever the graph (cost matrix) or the goal changes, call solveBackward
 *      once to fill the next-hop table.
 *   2. As long as both stay fixed, querying the path from any new start `s` is
 *      a constant-time table lookup followed by a forward walk:
 *         u = s; while (u != goal) { emit(u); u = next_node[u]; }
 *
 * Two cost-matrix layouts are supported, selected by the `symmetric` flag:
 *
 *   - Asymmetric (default, symmetric = false): full N*N row-major matrix.
 *     `cost[i * num_nodes + j]` is the cost of the directed edge i -> j.
 *
 *   - Symmetric (symmetric = true): packed upper triangle, no diagonal.
 *     Buffer length is N*(N-1)/2 floats and indexed according to symmetricPairIndex.
 *     Self-loops are not stored; Dijkstra ignores them anyway.
 *
 * Entries equal to +INFINITY or NaN are treated as missing edges. Negative
 * costs are not supported (Dijkstra assumes non-negative edge weights).
