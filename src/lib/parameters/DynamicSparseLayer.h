/**
 * DynamicSparseLayer - a parameter layer that stores only the parameters that
 * have actually been set, in a heap-allocated array that grows on demand.
 *
 * ## Data layout
 *
 * `_slots` points to a heap array of `_n_slots` Slot entries. The first
 * `_next_slot` entries are "valid" (a param->value override) and are kept
 * sorted by `param` ascending so lookups can binary-search them (_getIndex()).
 * The remaining `_n_slots - _next_slot` entries are unused, filled with the
 * sentinel {UINT16_MAX, {}} (UINT16_MAX sorts to the end). When the valid
 * entries fill the array (`_next_slot == _n_slots`), _grow() reallocates a
 * bigger one.
 *
 * ## Concurrency model
 *
 * A single recursive mutex - taken by constructing an AtomicTransaction - guards
 * ALL three members (`_slots`, `_next_slot`, `_n_slots`). Every public method
 * takes it for its whole duration, so readers and writers never see a partial
 * update and never race. (On NuttX AtomicTransaction disables interrupts; on
 * POSIX it is a recursive pthread mutex.)
 *
 * There is exactly ONE place the lock is dropped mid-operation: _grow() has to
 * call malloc()/free(), which must not run with the lock held (on NuttX the lock
 * disables interrupts, and the allocator takes its own locks). So _grow()
 * *unlocks around the allocation only*. That single window is the reason store()
 * and _grow() are written as re-checking loops rather than straight-line code:
 * while the lock is dropped another writer may grow the buffer or take a slot, so
 * any value read before the window must be re-validated after it. Nothing else in
 * this class ever observes a concurrent modification, because nothing else
 * releases the lock.
 *
 * `_slots` is a px4::atomic only so that this unlock-around-malloc window is
 * well-defined; given every access is under the mutex it could equally be a plain
 * pointer.
 *
 * ## Why the lock is dropped on POSIX too (do not "optimize" this away)
 *
 * Only NuttX *needs* _grow() to drop the lock: there the lock disables interrupts
 * and malloc()/free() can't run in that state. On POSIX the lock is an ordinary
 * recursive mutex, so _grow() could just hold it across the allocation and the
 * unlock/lock pair would be unnecessary for correctness. We drop it on BOTH
 * platforms deliberately. ThreadSanitizer and the concurrent stress tests only run
 * on POSIX/SITL - if the unlock window existed solely on NuttX, the entire
 * concurrent-grow path (the re-check loops, the count-based ABA guard) would run
 * only on the platform we cannot instrument, and a bug in it would surface only on
 * hardware. Keeping the code path identical lets SITL+TSan exercise the exact same
 * window that runs on NuttX. So: do not #ifdef the unlock away on POSIX "because
 * it isn't needed there" - that would hide the embedded concurrency from the only
 * tooling that can catch bugs in it.
